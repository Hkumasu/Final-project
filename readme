To launch this project you will need Bank abstract class, converter interface, bank_information.txt, USBank class, and JapaneseBank class.
USBank and JapaneseBank classes has their own main method.
If you compile USBank, then the the program will start as US bank account.
If you compile JapaneseBank, then the program will start as Japanese account.


This is description about the JapaneseBank class and USBank class.
They have the same methods.
In the both main methods, 8 objects will concreate in general. However, in my code, I have only JapaneseBank and USBank classes.
So, only two objects will create base on the class. I make other 6 objects as comments. If you combine other group members
classes, then make the concrete object uncommmented.

There is 7 options to transit from the bank to another currency bank. However, only one option will work
since I cannot create other objects. 
In the USBank class, only converting to Yen works.
In the Japanese class, only converting to US Dollar works.


Each bank total saving will read from file(bank_information.txt) and concreate object by using the information.
If you choose the "exit" option, the bank infromation will be save in the same file(bank_information.txt).

By compiling the code, the option will show on the console.
Only displaying convert and description will be display on GUI.

constructor: just set up the instant variable
deposit method: add the amount of money that users entered to total saving.
withdraw method: subtract the amount of money taht users entered to total saving.

               action will record by using linked list. Also call print recrod to write the

                    Even though the window is closed, the program will keep going the program.

                  In the USBank, convert from US dollar to another currency.

transitFromOtherBank method: add the amount that transit from another bank to total saving.
transitToOtherBank method: subtract the amount from total saving. And, convert the amount
                    to another bank currency.
                    call another bank's transitToOtherBank to add the converting amount
                    to total saving.
