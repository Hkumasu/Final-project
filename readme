To launch this project you will need Bank abstract class, converter interface, bank_information.txt, USBank class, JapaneseBank class.
USBank and JapaneseBank classes has their own main method.
If you compile USBank, then the the program will start as US bank account.
If you compile JapaneseBank, then the program will start as Japanese account.


This is description about the JapaneseBank class and USBank class.
They have the same methods.
In the both main methods, 8 objects will concreate in general. However, in my code, I have only JapaneseBank and USBank classes.
So, two objects will create base on the class.

By compiling the code, the option will show on the console.
Only displaying convert and description will be display on GUI.

deposit method: add the amount of money that users entered to total saving.
withdraw method: subtract the amount of money taht users entered to total saving.
calculate interest mehtod: calculate interest years base on the year that users entered. 
                           Recursive is used in here.
record method: print out the action deposit, withdraw, transit to other bank. Those three 
               action will record by using linked list. Also call print recrod to write the
               data to file.
printRecord method: write the those three actions record to the file.
description method: Display the currency rates, interest rate, and total saving in GUI. 
                    Even though the window is closed, the program keep going.
converter method: convert from the bank currency to another bank currency. 
                  In the USBank, convert from US dollar to another currency.
                  In the JapaneseBank, conver from Yen to another currency.
transitFromOtherBank:
transitToOtherBank: subtract the amount from total saving. And, convert the amount
                    to another bank currency.
                    call another bank's transitToOtherBank to add the converting amount
                    to total saving.
